# CSE-3150-EX-6

How to run the programm itself:

Uncomment the main function at the bottom of vector.cpp (I commented it out so that the test file works)
run:   g++ vector.cpp
and then: ./a.out
make sure to put the comment bars back before running unit test file !!! 


UNIT TESTS:
1. if you ran the main function in vector.cpp first, please add the comment bars back around it. OTHERWISE TEST WONT RUN !
2. g++ unit_test_vector.cpp vector.cpp
3.  ./a.out

4.  This should have 2 cases with 7 assertions that all pass.
